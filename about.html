            <h2>Why I chose to be a programmer</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up surrounded by technology and computers, I found my inspiration and drive 
                in my father's career as a programmer. Many of my family 
                members have also pursued roles in the tech industry, further fueling my interest and commitment to this field.
