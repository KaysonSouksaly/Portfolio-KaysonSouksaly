                    <p>Digiseller is my final project for a CSS design class. It implements my use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
                    It was previously done in PHP for a better universal header and footer. However it was migrated fully on 
                    Javascript as I host my pages in Github, which does not support PHP</p>

                    <h2>Loan Application</h2>
                    <p>I've created a loan application using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL Databases. It was to demonstrate my ability to
                        to use MySQL and PHP for server side application with a login, store and retrieve data from the Databases.
                        I further my work with a demo of a simple APR calculator, monthly and yearly payments, and eligibility for the loan.
