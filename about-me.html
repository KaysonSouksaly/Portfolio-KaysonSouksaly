        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Why I chose to be a programmer</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario, with a strong passion for programming, 
            particularly in web development and design. Growing up surrounded by technology and computers, 
            I found my inspiration and drive in my father's career as a programmer. Many of my family members 
            have also pursued roles in the tech industry, further fueling my interest and commitment to this field.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and dabbling in amateur carpentry. 
            These hobbies provide me with a creative outlet that helps develop patience and attention to detail. 
            I pride myself on my ability to work well in teams and my adaptability and flexibility in various 
            situations make me a reliable and effective team member.</p>
